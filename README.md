# Optimization-Final-Project
Optimization final project, performing P-Medians and K-Means models on transport data

In this project, we were given the freedom to choose a desired topic on our own. My group ended up optimizing a transport problem (given suppliers and demanders), and wanted to find optimal midpoints minimizing the distance to the demanders. In order to do this, we performed a P-Medians model, as well as a K-Means model, to obtian optimal results.
